```
This project is to implement an store API where we provide a bunch of search option for our users.
The main area of focus in this project is advance filtering, sorting and dynamically populating our databse as well as some other cool stuffs.
Here, the back-end does all the heavy lifting and the front-end is only responsible for making http calls or requests.
We used Atlas mongoDB cloud for database.
Also used Postman for monitoring http requests and responses.
It was really a great learning experience.
Thanks to John Smilga for helping me out with this project.
